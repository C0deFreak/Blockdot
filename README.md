Pygame, although good, isn't the easiest to work with for beginners. My hope is to make a template for you to be able to make a simple blocky game without fighting with things like colliders, procedural generation, player controller ect.
My inspiration is the Godot engine, but I love making everything using just code witch has it's pros such as the engine being smaller by memory size. I always loved making games in pure code and this project will help everyone who don't want
to make everything from scratch but want some modern capabilities
